# üîÅ Uniswap-Style AMM (Constant Product) ‚Äì LUNE Ecosystem

This is a simplified **Uniswap-style Automated Market Maker (AMM)** smart contract built from scratch using pure Solidity, without any external libraries or imports (e.g., OpenZeppelin). It implements the **x * y = k** constant product formula and supports **two custom ERC-20 tokens**.

Part of the broader **LUNE ecosystem**, this contract demonstrates core DeFi mechanics with transparency and modularity in mind.

## üöÄ Features

- üßÆ **Constant Product AMM**: Implements Uniswap V2's `x * y = k` formula.
- üîÄ **Token Swaps**: Enables swapping between two ERC-20 tokens.
- üè¶ **Liquidity Provisioning**: Users can add/remove liquidity.
- üßæ **LP Share Tracking**: Manual tracking of LP token shares (no ERC-20 minting).
- üì¶ **Zero Dependencies**: No OpenZeppelin or external contracts used.

## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment

Deployed via [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org)  
Network: **Sepolia Testnet**

You can find the deployed contracts and interactions in the Remix workspace or test them on Sepolia.

## üß† Purpose

This repo is part of my on-chain proof-of-work:  
> *I‚Äôm not just learning DeFi ‚Äî I‚Äôm rebuilding it from first principles.*

It‚Äôs a self-contained, transparent build showing:
- Deep understanding of DeFi math and mechanics
- Comfort with Solidity without abstractions
- Early infrastructure for a modular DeFi + space data protocol: **LUNE**

---

## üìå Next Steps

- Simulate token liquidity and swap scenarios
- Expand LP logic to ERC-20 LP tokens
- Gas optimization
- Integrate into LUNE dashboard in future phase
